I created this wiki around 2nd March'20, and today is 13th May of the same year. Currently it has 23 directories, 119 files. While trying to add some notes about Matrices, I really felt the need to have support for [LaTeX style math equations](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX).

After looking around for sometime, I decided that it's time to step aside and work on migrating my wiki to `DocusaurusV2`, so I did. It has nice plugin support for the math syntax I was looking for, but [I did face some issues along the way](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2742). All in all, the migration was nice and I like the new look and feel üòç
