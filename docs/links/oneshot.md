I had a GitHub repository called `geekodour/oneshot`(no longer public) for storing learning resources on various topics that I used in my undergraduate years(most probably the darkest years of my life, hopefully). Most of it is reference material. Some of the links are worth sharing, some are things that i just find interesting. Expect a lot of outdated links but I plan to keep adding interesting links to this.

> I am going to cut down links from this page eventually based on the less "only links" rule from [notetaking](/docs/notes/guides/notetaking). Some links are shifted to [workshops/guides](/docs/workshops/tech-guides) and [workshop/projects](/docs/workshops/projects) aswell.
