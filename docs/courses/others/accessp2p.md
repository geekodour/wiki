## Summary

Most of these lectures probably were not meant to be watched online, as they involved offline activities etc, also the audio was pretty bad. But overall nice content.

## Intro to P2P

üé• [Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcmyE8cUQRI)

This talk was actually pretty boring and repetitive, could have been a twitter thread. It talks about the social prospects of P2P, It might be interesting for someone who's totally new to P2P but there were few nice things Stacco points out:

- Considering facts like _"84% of English Wikipedia editors were male in 2013"_, are we really decentralizing if we're not examining who's creating the technology or the content? Who's value systems are we putting into these technologies?
- Internet by itself is P2P and centralized systems are built on top of it.
- Shared economies: Take Airbnb for an example, It looks like you're practicing P2P transactions with each other but in reality you're just transacting what the platform allows you to do.

## Mechanism Design

An Introduction to auction and mechanism design as well as a survey of the most relevant topics at the intersection of computer science and economics. This lecture again has very bad audio.

- **Game Theory**: How to play a game? What is the outcome of strategic interaction between actors in a given game?
- **Mechanism Design**: - How do we design the game? How do we create rules within the game to obtain a certain outcome?
