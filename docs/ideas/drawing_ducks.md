I am very bad at drawing things but someday I wish to draw amazing duck drawings. Why specifically ducks, you may ask. I've been a massive duck lover since early 2019, when I saw a duck meme. Unfortunately, I don't remember which one it was.

Ducks are very beautiful, they walk funny and are lovely creatures. I love ducks, so it'll be great to draw something I love.

> Fun fact: A male duck is called a drake, a female duck a hen, and a baby duck a duckling.

I've always been a bird lover, Heck! even felt bad when I had to kill those birds in duck hunt as a kid.

To improve on drawing ducks I'll have to practice basic shape drawings initially, I'll be working on my shapes and doing random duck drawings on my instagram page @quacklines.

Hope, I'll be able to draw cool ducks in a year or two.
