> The organization and content of this doc is very much a subject to change. This is mostly about the Indian Education System.

1. Not having enough teachers
2. Not having enough teachers that are trained
3. Pedagogy is not right
4. Policy makers are confused where should they prioritize
5. Poor learning levels
6. Very little assessment to compare one school to another
7. Not enough data to understand the disparity among schools
8. How to keep good teachers in rural schools
9. Learning gap between govt and private schools [1](http://www.ncaer.org/event_details.php?EID=38), [2](https://yourstory.com/socialstory/2019/04/andhra-pradesh-govt-schools-reducing-learning-gap)
10. Teacher education currently does not raise or appreciate the curiosity of teachers. There are so many bricks but not so many houses of the right kind, there are so many teachers but not many of the right kind.
11. Current teachers lack the understanding to use modern edtech tools. Eg. Teacher telling students to upload photos of handwritten assignments to Google Classroom, of which the answer is the exact same for every student.
12. **Language problem:** It might seem like that we've solved the language problem because you can translate any document/website/book using Google Translate to your own language with somewhat accuracy. Also authors who realize the potential of their books can opt in for translations to various languages. Now we can either bring all of them into one single language and have everyone understand that language. That will be loss for diversity. Different languages hinders accessibility though, eg. If an Assamese writer wrote an amazing book in Assamese and it never got translated to some other local language because there's no market for it. What if some kid would really be inspired by the content of that book, which he was denied accessbility just because he cannot read/understand that language. Licensing can solve this partly. **More**: several parties are fluent in various languages, but none of them speak the others' native language. However they all speak a little Esperanto. While they might get by with numerous translations of other languages, each language being understood by a few participants, Esperanto is the lowest common denominator.
13. No trust in books, I was not sure if my book was teaching me the right math because there were so many mistakes.
14. Students don't trust the board. Papers get leaked, results come out without verification. Some student who didn't give exams comes out as passed!
15. Lack of proper mentorship.
16. Huge gap between globalization and Indian students belonging to middleclass and below middleclass families. Internet is filling the gap in an opaque manner.
17. The current education system demotivates students.
18. [Colleges in India](http://archive.is/zzhaP)
19. Student satisfaction != Teaching Quality and Schooling != Education.
20. Medical Education : http://archive.is/19ZNG
21. People think a 'modern' classroom is one that has tech. No, a modern classroom is one that treats students differently - foregrounds their agency in constructing their understanding, removes the hierarchy in learning. You can have a lot of tech and still run an outdated classroom - Subir Shukla
