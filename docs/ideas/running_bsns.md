> I am the last person I'd go for business advice. These are just random thoughts that I'd **probably** like to experiment with someday.

- Have some kind of company culture that puts out interesting thing on the internet that slightly diverges from what your company actually does. Example could be running a [TIL site](https://til.hashrocket.com/) that could benifit anyone from the Internet but the contents of it are from employees. So you've a new way to reach people and your employee have fun doing so aswell.
