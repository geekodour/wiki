- Have some kind of company culture that puts out interesting thing on the internet that slightly diverges from what your company actually does. Example could be running a [TIL site](https://til.hashrocket.com/) that could benifit anyone from the Internet but the contents of it are from employees. So you've a new way to reach people and your employee have fun doing so aswell.

- 4 fits
  - problems that u are solving
  - the channels that u use to reach the customer (business model)
