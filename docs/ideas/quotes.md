Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming."
- And we must study through reading, listening, discussing, observing, and thinking. We must not neglect any one of those ways of studying. The trouble with most of us is that we fall down on the latter - thinking - because it's hard work for people to think.
