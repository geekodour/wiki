### Getting shit done

- Opportunity cost: Think about if this will be valuable use of the time.
- 10/10/10: do if will be doing it in 10 days,months and years.
- Saying no.
- Sunk cost fallacy: let go of things when you see diminishing results.
- Zero days

### Doing Hard things

- Finding something that is easy, then modify it to be like the hard task in **one** way.
- Do it until it's no longer hard, recursively apply the same.
- Try **different** ways to make it hard.

### Munger operating system

- To get what you want, deserve what you want.
- Acquiring wisdom is a moral duty as well as a practical one.
- Use frameworks and mental models to think and store information.
- Be reliable
- Avoid intense ideologies
- _I‚Äôm not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think that only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak._
- Get rid of self-pity because it generates paranoia, paranoia is hard to reverse.
- Get rid of self-serving bias and at the same time let others have it. Don't try to control it for others.
- Learn the all-important concept of assiduity: Sit down and do it until it‚Äôs done.

- Reading non-fiction is different from reading fiction
- Reading technical/math book is way more different than reading non-fiction

### Stevey's math rant

- Conventional wisdom does not add up.
- As a programmer, you can teach yourself math the correct way.
- For programmers, the most useful branch of discrete math is probability theory.
- I think it would be nice if every math course spent a full week just introducing you to the subject, in the most fun way possible, so you know why the heck you're learning it. Heck, that's probably true for every course.
- The right way to learn math is breadth-first, not depth-first. You need to survey the space, learn the names of things, figure out what's what.
- division is just repeated subtraction.
- if you see a thick nest of them your inclination is probably to skip right over that sucker as one atomic operation. - on math notations

### Uncharity of educational institutions

- This article is interesting, but it makes the fundamental error of assuming that the primary product of an R1 research university is education for undergraduates, which it is not. The primary product of an R1 research university is research, largely performed by Graduate Students, Postdoctoral Researchers and Professional Researchers.

### Reading Research: A Guide for Software Engineers

- The author is known for reading research papers among his peers, blogpost is a summary of his approach. His paper reading mental models: Solution Finding, Discovery and Curosity
- **Solution Finding**: Immediate solutions for problems at hand, similar to reading SO/reference books.
- **Discovery**: This is basically going down the rabbithole idea but which a aim to improve/optimize find better alternatives to your original idea.
- **Curosity**: This is my favorite, just reading things out of curosity! It can surprise you how useful these random ideas can be :)
- Sometimes learning a new field from primary research can be very difficult. Author is often surprised when he revisits something after a couple years and finds that he understand it now.
- The post has some nice tips for finding papers to read. One approach is to avoid reading new papers at all. Focus on the classics, and let time filter out papers that are worth reading.
- Paper writers are mostly one of these three: Academics, Engineers, Industrial Labs(Bell Labs etc.)
- Results that haven‚Äôt been peer reviewed, or rejected from peer review aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong. Be a little wary of results when reading papers. The primary metric when analyzing results is the **methods** used, eg. For distributed systems this could be **scaling**.
- Long term learning is a good way to get time for reading research papers.
