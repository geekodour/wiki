> Thing is, I wanted to be a scientist when I was a kid; but the education system proved that I am not smart enough to be a scientist and I gaveup on that dream when I was 17. I am 23 now and I realized that life is full of surprises and it's good to be prepared, just in case. I have not done any real research but I've always been a tinkerer, hence keeping a list of project and people I'd like to do research work with someday. Just another silly dream.
