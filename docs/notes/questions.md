Random questions that I am too lazy to google an answer for now.

- Why did üê¶ pegion mail stop? It was the most kickass thing of all time.
- How do birds know about time.
- Does binary-code compatibility mean that a x86 program compiled with a intel cpu will work in x86 processor of some amd cpu?
- how does one avoid getting electric shock by putting one [hand inside their pockets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cozcXiSSkwE)
- [having their resulting additional processor execution time offset by infrequent use.](/docs/notes/study/comp_arch#classification), what does this line mean?
- I don't understand the evolution of computer bus, PATA,SATA,USB,SCSI,PS/2,plugnplay,IDE etc. What?
- [Where does the MMU live? Inside the CPU?](/docs/notes/study/memory#virtual-memory) : probably
- How are directories implemented in operating systems.
- is sampling and counting examples of continuos and discrete [data in perf?](/docs/books/perf_little_book)
- How energy is stored in birds, they can keep flying in the sky with the energy that they have. It's pretty impressive, same with humans where is the evergy storage. mitochoneria but interesting that energy is distributed and do not come from a centralized place like eg. light from the sun. leave birds, think about bees. I get all the aerodynamics and all but it's just amazing that that tiny thing is capable of flying. things of its same weight are just laying on the ground(eg. some light weight some say).
- Did TELNEL not use port numbers initially because TCP/IP was published few years later?
- Why do we need both multicast L2 address reservation and L3 address reservation. something related to this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast#Layer_2_delivery
- afaiu, heap and stack both are in the memory. stack are probably stored closer to cpu in some caches if possible. but i want to see it for real.
- My sister told me that the plants that we see in top of buildings are bird poops pooping seeds. Or dust just bringing in the seeds. It's Amazing how discributed plants and seeds are. They can just grow anywhere provided the environment. That's true for everything but just think how simple a seed is, how flexible it is to just travel and be placed somewhere and grow into a plant few weeks later. is this true? the poop thing.
- Sometimes when you're working on a problem, that problem has been researched before, it even has a name. How do you figure that out without having a lot of domain specific knowledge?
