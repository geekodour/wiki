I've walked the earth and after I die, people will still be able to access this page. These are the people(*unordered*) who made the most direct positive impact in my silly little worthless life. This list is surely not exhaustive. I'll always be thankful to all of them.

I wanted to write about each of them here briefly but due to privacy reasons, I won't do that. I am planning to send handwritten thankyou notes the next year on NYE. I know it'll be super awkward, but it's better than regretting later.
