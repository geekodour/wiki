As technology became more of a distribution model in which people could replicate things easily and inexpensively, the govt. felt the need to add regulations and legislation.

## Copyright

Copyright provides an powerful protection for the creator or the owner of a particular piece of work.

## Copyleft

Copyleft is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to art, to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine. In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives a copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it, with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing terms.

## Fair use

Fair use allows people to use parts of copyrighted materials without taking permission if some guidelines are met.

## Digital Rights Management(DRM)

Goal of DRM is to use some combination of software and hardware capabilities with regard to what you can do with digital content. I don't like DRM.

## Digital Millinium Copyright Act (DMCA) - 1998

- **Anti circumvention**: If a copyright holder places some kind of DRM on their work, it's **illegal** for you to figure out how it works! just the attempt is illegal!
- **Safe harbour**: ISP now could allow their users to freely share content without the fear of that they might be liable for the infrengements done by their remote clients. Similarly for YouTube, YT is not responsible if a YT user decides to put/access illegal content on their site, the end user is liable. This same law allows coppyright holders to request takedown of copyright content (**DMCA takedown notice**)

## Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) - 2011

Supporters of this bill argued that this was needed to prevent widespread theft of copyrighted work. Eventually this bill was dropped.

## All Software Licenses.
