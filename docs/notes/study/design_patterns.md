> Not really SDPs, but some general development ideas/words/**jargons** that i come accross. Most of them are just me reading its wikipedia page and writing whatever i understood here.

## Unread

- [Dynamic Scoping](https://wiki.c2.com/?DynamicScoping)
- [Rusty's API Design Manifesto](http://sweng.the-davies.net/Home/rustys-api-design-manifesto)
- https://wiki.c2.com/?LongFunctionsDiscussion

- [Some Property Testing Tricks](https://throughascreendarkly.com/2020/09/01/some-property-testing-tricks/)

## Databases

- [Water mark](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark_(data_file)>) : a method for ensuring data integrity.
- [Tombstone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)>): A tombstone is a deleted record in a replica of a distributed data store.

## Memory

- [Thread-local storage(TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage) : It's just storage specific to the running thread, many threads can have a variable called `a`; `a` is local to each thread. One usage can be multiple threads accumulating information into a global variable with some kind of sync ofc.
- [Rotational Latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_performance_characteristics#Rotational_latency): Time waiting for the first bit of target sector to pass under `r/w head`. Delay waiting for the rotation of the disk to bring the required(eg. requested by cpu) disk sector under the `r/w head` is the **Seek time**.
- [Stride of an array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_of_an_array) : The stride determines the distance between two elements, which will be greater than or equal to the `size` of the element. Sometimes sequential access is also called `stride-1 pattern`/`stride-unit pattern`.

![](/img//stride-padding.png)

```
[a,b,c,d] // say elements are `int64`; here stride is 4bytes if there is no padding.
[a,b,c,d] // say elements are some `struct`; here stride is size of the structs; having padding will change the stride.
```

- [Scratchpad memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchpad_memory) : Not very popular apparently, something like L1 cache ig.

## Programming

- [Re-entrancy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)>): Subroutine is called reentrant if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently, i.e execution and then safely be called again/re-enter before its previous invocations complete execution.
- [Loop Unrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling): Technique that attempts to optimize a program's execution speed at the expense of its binary size. It increase a program's speed by reducing or eliminating instructions that control the loop. [Duff's device](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/514118/how-does-duffs-device-work) is a way of manually implementing loop unrolling.

## Software Architecture

- C4 : https://c4model.com/
- [Active record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern) : The RoR ActiveRecords are implementation of this pattern! Martin Flower coined this.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract
