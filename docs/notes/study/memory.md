> The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) page for computer memory would probably be a better place but here are my lousy notes on memory. mind you, this is not strictly about memory management doe. The types of memory always confused me, so I thought a quick note page will be worth it.

## Notes

- [Notes on Garbage Collection](/docs/notes/study/memory/gc)
- [Notes on Memory Allocation](/docs/notes/study/memory/alloc)
- [Notes on Memory Hierarchy](/docs/notes/study/memory/mem_hie)
- [Notes on Virtual Memory](/docs/notes/study/memory/vm)
- [Notes on Cache](/docs/notes/study/memory/cache)
- [Notes on Memory Metrics](/docs/notes/study/memory/mem_metrics)

## Jargons/Rabbit Holes (Unread)

Read links will be removed and added somewhere else where they fit better.

- [Memory Access Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_access_pattern): It is usual for modern processors to have more load execution units, than store units. And next Intel architecture, named Haswell, supports only GATHER instruction, while SCATTER is not yet in their plans. All this is also in favor of "writes stride one" pattern.
