Basically the challenge is to transfer zeros and ones into waveforms.

You can control the amplitude(*How strong is a signal*), and the Frequency.

## Shannon capacity theorem
It tells the **maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel** of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise. Depending on how good my encoding(converting bits into waveforms) is, one can approach some fraction of the Shannon limit.

## ISM(industrial, scientific and medical) bands
The use of frequency is regulated by the governments. The ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum(RF spectrum) reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) purposes **other than telecommunications.** cordless phones, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC and a host of other short range wireless applications use the ISM band. You don't need a license to operate in the ISM bands.
