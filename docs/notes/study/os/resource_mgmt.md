Traditionally we had `ulimit` but problems with all that is that it's hard to verify if things are working as expected.

ps uses `/proc`, how is `/proc` populated? kernel populates it from the address space of the process!

The ulmit shell command is built around `setrlimit`

a program can change its own soft limit at any time by calling setrlimit

Thing to understand about these tools that these are per process and not systemwide
