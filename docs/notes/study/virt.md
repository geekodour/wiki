virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.

Two kinds
- System virtual machines/full virtualization
- Process virtual machines

Some virtual machines, such as QEMU, are designed to also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture.
