## Intro

A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number. Some references refer logarithm as an exponent. It can find the cause for an effect, i.e the **input for some output**

John Napier introduced Logarithm as a means of simplifying calculations in [1614](/docs/notes/history#1614), that's about 400 years ago. It can do amazing and boring(?) things like counting zeros of a number($log_{10}(1000)=3$), extracting the fifth root of 27, list goes on.

### A look into the definition

- If $x>0$ and $b>0, b\ne1$ then $y=log_b(x)$ iff $b^y=x$
- In the equation $y=log_b(x)$, $y$ is called the **logarithm.**
- Logarithmic functions are only defined for positive real numbers.
- The function $log_b(x)$ is continuous for $x>0$
- This means that $x$ should always be positive and $b$ should always be greater than 1.

Proving that $x$ needs to be positive is simple; If $x$ were negative or 0, $b^y$ has to result in a negative number or 0. No matter what $y$ is, since $b$ is a positive number it's [never going to be a negative number or 0.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuX7T4PM1Mc)

Now why does $b$(the base) has to be greater than 1?

$b^y=x\ \implies\ b^{log_b(x)}=x$

| 1    | For $x=5$, $log_1(5)$ has no solution.<br/> For $x=1$, $log_1(1)$ can be anything.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 0    | For $x=0$, $log_0(0)$ can be anything, otherwise it does not have a solution. We also know that $x$ can't be $0$                                                                                                                        |
| -2   | $(-2)^3=-8$ i.e $log_{-2}(-8)=3$ ðŸ›‘ (not valid with $log$ because you can't take [even roots of negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root). Eg. $(-2)^{1.01}=(-2)^{\frac{101}{100}}=\sqrt[100]{2^{101}}$ is not defined! |

## Bases

Now that we know that bases positive and greater than 1, there are some well known bases that we come across often.

- Common Log: $log_{10}$ written as lg
- Natural Log: $log_e$ written as ln
- Binary Log: $log_2$ written as lb

Each of these have special peoperties and uses; going through each of them:

### Common Log

Logarithms that differ by a factor of a power of 10 all have the same fractional part.

Decade

### Natural Log

### Binary Log

Octave
