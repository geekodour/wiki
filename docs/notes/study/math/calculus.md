## Limits

> Basic idea: When $x$ is approaching the some number, **what is $f(x)$/$y$/the function approaching**?

- For $f(x)=\frac{x-1}{x-1}; f(x)=1, x\ne1$ i.e there is a discontinuity.
- $\lim\limits_{x\to1}\frac{x-1}{x-1}=1$ means that $f(x)$ is also approaching 1 as $x$ is approaching 1.

Another example,

$g(x)=\begin{cases}
   x^2,x\ne2\\
   1,x=2
\end{cases}$

- $\lim\limits_{x\to2}g(x)=4$ means that $g(x)$ is approaching 4 as $x$ is approaching 2.
- But we can see that as soon as $x$ is 2, $g(x)$ will be $1$.
