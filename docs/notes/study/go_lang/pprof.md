When I was reading about `pprof` for the first time, I wanted to understand two things; what is it? and how to understand [these graphs](https://www.robustperception.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/viewport.png). I think I finally have some hold of both now, so here is my understanding of `pprof` in form of a blogpost in the simplest way. If you find any mistake, please feel free to comment in this issue. After reading this you should be able to make some sense of that graph and the options that we use in `pprof` should make more sense. But the official documantations are pretty great too!

First and foremost it is not one single thing, but a collection of tools and packages. It is tightly coupled with the go programming language and is widely used for profiling go programs. This is how I would breakdown `pprof` for my understanding:

- `go tool pprof`: A tool visualization/analysing `profile data`. Commonly refered to as `pprof`, I'll call this `go tool pprof` throughout the documentation just to avoid any confusion.
- `runtime/pprof`: A package that writes runtime `profiling data` in the format expected by `go tool pprof`.
- `net/http/pprof`: A package that allows any program running a HTTP sever to serve `profiling data` in the format expected by `go tool pprof`
- `profile.proto`: It is the data representation for `profile data`, It's a protocol buffer description. This is the format expected by `go tool pprof`

Folowing sections give a little explanation to each of these and example to play with aswell!

## Profiling

Before we start, It's important to understand what profiling really is. Profiling refers to the collection of data that can reflect the execution status of the program during the execution of the program. In software engineering, performance analysis (also known as profiling) is a method of analyzing program behavior by collecting program run-time information. It is a method of dynamic program analysis. It is very useful for identifying expensive or frequently called sections of code.

Examples of profiling tools: gperftools, [Linux perf tools](/docs/books/perf_little_book) etc, Interesting to know that `pprof` can work with [`perf.data` aswell](https://github.com/google/pprof#using-pprof-with-linux-perf)

## Profiling with `pprof`

In case of `pprof`, each `profile data` is a collection of samples and is of the format [`profile.proto`](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/proto/profile.proto). The golang packages `runtime/pprof` and `net/http/pprof` helps in generating `profile data` and the `pprof` tool can generates reports out of the `profile data` to further visualize and analyze the data. The `profile data` can be read from a **local file**, or **over http**. Multiple profiles of the same type can be aggregated or compared, the `pprof` tool makes this very convnient.

- Basic usage [can be found here.](https://github.com/google/pprof#basic-usage)
- [Profiling Go Programs](https://blog.golang.org/pprof)

### `profile.proto`

[`profile.proto`](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/proto/profile.proto) is a Protocol Buffer v3 description file. It is the format that profile data uses. On disk, it is represented as a gzip-compressed protocol buffer. Eg. `profile.pb.gz`

Profile data represent data collected through statistical sampling of our programs; we call these samples. Each sample is associated to a point in a **location hierarchy/call stack**, one or more **numeric values**, and a [**set of labels**](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/17280-profile-labels.md). It is independent of the type of data being collected and the sampling process used to collect that data.

This allows [custom pprof profiles](https://rakyll.org/custom-profiles/). Additionally to what [is provided by the runtime](https://godoc.org/runtime/pprof#Profile), Go users can create their custom profiles via `pprof.Profile` and use the existing tools to examine them.

### `go tool pprof`

[`go tool pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof/tree/master/doc) primarily does reporting by display the profile data in multiple forms, such as identifying hottest locations, building graphical call graphs or trees, etc which the user can further analyse to make their program work better or to identify bottlenecks.

It is primarily used in three ways:

- Report generation: `pprof <format> [options] source`
- Interactive terminal: `pprof [options] source`
- [Web interface](https://rakyll.org/pprof-ui/): `pprof -http=[host]:[port] [options] source`

So the callgraph that I mentioned in the start of this post is just one of the many ways `go tool pprof` can visualize profile data. It probably uses [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)/`gv` and its [DOT format](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>) for it, It also [uses D3](https://github.com/google/pprof/tree/master/third_party) for some other visualizations. In addition, it also supports exporting these visualizations into various common formats such as `png`,`gif`, `pdf` etc.
The interpretation of the graph is [very nicely explained here.](https://github.com/google/pprof/tree/master/doc#interpreting-the-callgraph) Reading this was like switching on the light in a dark room. ðŸ’¯

The help command to show all options is `go tool pprof -h`, I think the same options are described much better in [the README](https://github.com/google/pprof/tree/master/doc#options)

### Golang libraries

There are two packages that help profile your go programs:

- Runtime Profiling : Usually for non-HTTP applications/libbraries etc [`runtime/pprof`](https://godoc.org/runtime/pprof)
- Net Profiling: Good for live applications or applications that are already using a http server [`net/http/pprof`](https://godoc.org/net/http/pprof)

## `pprof` and production

- The profiler, for the most part, has very minimal CPU overhead. The execution tracer can have a small overhead, but still small enough that we happily run it in production for a few seconds each hour.
- [Your pprof is showing](https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/your-pprof-is-showing)
- The official debugging doc also has some notes on running `pprof` in prod.
