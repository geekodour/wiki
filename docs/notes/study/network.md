### VoIP

- [VoIP Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) : VoIP changed the communication paradigm from client-server to kind of a peer-to-peer model, meaning that any host may call any other host. Given that more than half of the Internet hosts are behind NAT, a number of NAT traversal solutions need to be developed in order to support VoIP.
