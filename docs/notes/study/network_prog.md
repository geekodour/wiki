- **What is a file descriptor?** A file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file. But (and here's the catch), that file can be a network connection, a FIFO, a pipe, a terminal, a real on-the-disk file, or just about anything else.
- **socket()** return the socket descriptor and we can use **send()** and **recv()** socket calls to communicate through it. You can even use **read()** and **write()** but **send()** and **recv()** gives more control.
- Different types of sockets:
  - Internet sockets (DARPA sockets, INET Sockets)
    - Stream Socket (`SOCK_STREAM`)
      - Reliable two way connected communication
      - Order is maintained
      - Error free
      - **Examples:** telnet, http
      - Uses TCP and IP
      - \*send()\*\* system call
    - Datagram Socket (`SOCK_DGRAM`)
      - Sometimes called connectionless sockets, but you can use **connect()** with it.
      - Error free
      - Uses UDP and IP
      - **Examples:** tftp, dhcpcd, games, streaming audio, video conf etc.
      - **sendto()** system call and just encaptulate the data with a method of choice.
    - Raw socket
    - more.
  - path names on a local node (Unix sockets)
    - Unix domain sockets use the file system as their address name space.
    - Processes reference Unix domain sockets as file system inodes
    - In addition to sending data, processes may send file descriptors across a Unix domain socket connection using the sendmsg() and recvmsg() system calls.
    - This allows the sending processes to grant the receiving process access to a file descriptor for which the receiving process otherwise does not have access to.
  - X.25 sockets .. and more.
  - Netlink socket
    - Successor to `ioctl`
    - Netlink is designed and used for transferring miscellaneous networking information between the kernel space and userspace processes.
- The actual network hardware and topology is transparent to the socket programmer

## Section 2

- IPv4 and IPv6

```
2001:0db8:c9d2:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051
2001:db8:c9d2:12::51

2001:0db8:ab00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
2001:db8:ab00::

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
::1
```

- The address `::1` is the loopback address. It always means "this machine I'm running on now". In IPv4, the loopback address is 127.0.0.1.
- Other than complete ipv4 and ipv6 address there's a compatibility mode to represent ipv4 address in ipv6
  - 192.0.2.33 can be written as `::ffff::192.0.2.33`
- netmask
  - netmask is always a bunch of 1-bits followed by a bunch of 0-bits.
- When about to transmit data, assume that data is in wrong host byte order; that way each time you transmit put the data in a conversion
  function that arranges data in big endian order.
  - htons()
  - htonl()
  - ntohs()
  - ntohl() all these are for 32 bit variant

### Data types used by the socket interface

- a socket descriptor `int`
- addrinfo `struct` : Prepare the socket address structure.
  - `getaddrinfo()` returns pointer to a LL of this structure
  - `ai_addr` field is a pointer to struct `sockaddr`
    - `sockaddr` : Dealing with `sockaddr` is done with struct `sockaddr_in` or `sockaddr_in6` for ipv6 -> they can be cast vice versa
      - The `connect()` system by default takes in `sockaddr`
      - `sockaddr_in` is therefore used as an replacement for `sockaddr`
      - `sockaddr_in` is padded with 0s in `sin_zero[8]` field using the `memset()` function
        - if using `sockaddr_in6` there is no `sin_zero` field
      - `sockaddr_in`'s `sin_port` should be in network byte order.
      - `sockaddr_in` has `sin_addr` struct which has `s_addr` field which is a `uint32_t`

### IP Address related functions

- `inet_pton()` : converts an IP address in numbers and dots to `sin_addr`
- `inet_ntop()` : converts a `sin_addr` to printable IP address in numbers and dots
- Printable to Network (pton)
- Network to Printable (ntop)
- `getaddrinfo` prefered over `gethostbyname()` ??????
- `getnameinfo` prefered over `gethostbyaddr()` ??????

## System calls finally!

#### `getaddrinfo()`

It helps setup the `structs` you need later on, it does not do any network setup.
