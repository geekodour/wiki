Inspired by the [Jargon File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File), here is a growing list of Jargons based on my experience with our world. I have another page called design patterns which might seem similar, but I'll try to keep more informal terms here.

- **HugOps**: It is a way to celebrate the human, empathetic side of building, shipping, and running software.
