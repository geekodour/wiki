## Decimal Separator

One thing that ate my head initially was that some people use `.` [as decimal separator. why bro?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator)

---

## million, billion, lakh, cr

- 1bn = 100cr = 9 zeros = $10^9$
- 1cr = 10mn = 100lac = 7 zeros = $10^7$
- 1mn = 10lac = 6 zeros = $10^6$
- 1lac = $10^5$

> For currency it's again multiplying by the currency. Eg. To me a millionaire you'll need:

> $75.69 \times 10^6 \approx 7*10^7$, so if you have around `â‚¹ 7cr` in your bank, you're a millionaire. ðŸ¤‘

## bandwidth, latency and throughput

Layman explanation don't @t me; You live in Guwahati and wish to send `200TiB` of pirated ebooks to your friend in Delhi, out of may options here are two:

- Send it via mailpost (`High Bandwidth`, `High Latency`)
- Send it via IP Network/Internet (`Low Bandwidth`, `Low Latency`)

It'll take a lot of time for your friend to download `200TiB` of data with the Internet but will be able to stream it the fastest due to lower latency than sending it via mailpost.

- **Bandwidth**: Amount of data you can send. **High Bandwidth is good.**
- **Latency**: How much time it takes for a signal(in our case the first signal) to travel to its destination. **Low Latency is good.**
- **Throughput**: How much data is travelling. **High Throughput is good.**

## Bytes

- 1e+9 bytes = 1e9 = $10^9$B = 2^30B = 1GB (1 Billion bytes in 1GB)
- 1e+6 bytes = 1e6 = $10^6$B = 2^20B = 1MB (1 Million bytes in 1MB)
- 8bits = 1byte $\implies$ 500KB = 4000Kb = 4Mb
- 12Mbps connection = 1.5MBps (network uses bps)

## Log scales

> _The distance from 1 to 2 is the same as the distance from 2 to 4, or from 4 to 8. Similarly 1 to 3 is the same as 3 to 9 and 10 to 100 is the same distance as 1 to 10. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been multiplied by 10 (or some other fixed factor) ;_

A scale of measurement where the position is marked using the logarithm of a value instead of the actual value. Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes.

Suppose you have the inputs, which have a **lot of variation:**

```
1, 3, 5134573435345, 0.0000000053453
```

Taking $log_{10}$ of these numbers we get:

```
0, 0.477, 12.7, -8.27
```

which seem plottable and easily comparable. The statement _"A speck of dust is half way between the size of an atom and the planet earth if you're using logarethmic scale."_ makes sense now.

Some measurements vary by a little at the small scale, or a lot at the large scale. Log scale is simply more convenient than a linear scale for these measurements. Richter Scale, concentration of ions (pH-scale), anything that involves our senses (f-stops in photography, decibels, octaves), entropy, star brightness etc. Some of these use $log_{10}$ and some use $log_2$

### Few funny things to care about

- There is no such thing called the exponential scale.
- Often exponential growth curves are displayed on a log scale.
- lin/linear scale is additive, while the log scale is multiplicative by a fixed number.

## Growth

Growth refers to how fast a sequence of numbers increase. Sometimes decay is used to mean the opposite. Before we get more into growth, Let's see the concept of **bound**. We say B bounds A (above) if B grows faster than A, that is, at some point B becomes bigger than A and stays bigger forever (the same apply for bounded below). **To look at growth, we look at the derivatives.**

Among other growth sequences, the most common are growth sequences that we see in the news are **Linear < Polynomial < Exponential**

> These growths are related to respective functions, So let $t$ be a variable signifying something like `time`, and let $f(t)$ be some kind of function of $t$. (Informal defs., see wikipedia for formal defs.)

### Linear Growth

> $f$ grows linearly if eventually, $f(t) = t$

Linear is a kind of polynomial, specifically of degree 1. Linear growth is the one most people will be familiar with, as it is everywhere in our daily life.

### Exponential Growth

> $f$ grows exponentially if eventually, $f(t) = e^{at}$ for some constant $a > 0$.

**Other names**: Proportional growth, Geometric growth(in the discrete domain)

Exponential growth refers to a pattern of growth that the rate of increase is proportional to its current value.

### Polynomial Growth

A polynomial function does not grow exponentially. An exponential function does grow exponentially. Quadratical, Cubic, Quartic,etc fall under this.

### Logarithmic Growth

> $f$ grows logarithmically if eventually, $f(t) = log(t)$.

Logarithmic growth is the inverse of exponential growth and is very slow.

## Order of Magnitude

An **order of magnitude** is an approximate [position on a **logarithmic scale.**](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude). Eg. $4\times10^6$ has a common logarithm of `~6.602`; Its order of magnitude is `6`.

## Inclusive and Exclusive

```
(0, 5) = 1, 2, 3, 4
(0, 5] = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[0, 5) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
[0, 5] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```
