I've a [huge memory problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DshRUOm-o), I think i forget everything eventually so to retain information, note-taking is essential. These methods are subject agnostic and personal experiments, just adjust it accordingly for math-heavy/technical subjects.

Try saving links to Pocket when you see shiny link on social media to avoid going down the rabbit hole otherwise add it to the `unread list` in specific study section of this wiki, where you can do proper study on the topic later on. Make sure you read and make notes of those dumps before they become too big!

**Tools:** Pen and paper, Google Keep, Google Doc, Anki, Notion, Pocket, ~~Liner~~, this wiki, ~/todo.txt

> - Any nibble worth remembering, transfer to Anki.
> - Any new word worth remembering, transfer to Anki.
> - Publish a doc named, Links(n) in this wiki summarizing notes from all media every week.
> - Never repeat things in the wiki, always link.
> - Remember to keep number of "only links" in the wiki low. If you readup on something, write a summary in the suitable section and link to original article.
> - Technical notetaking should go in `Study`
>
> #### Methodology
>
> - Systematic: on a regular basis, read the major chapters (possibly unordered) of the entire books.
> - Ad hoc: read a specific chapter, section, or topic.
> - Timer: set a timer when reading and note-taking to ensure efficiency.

## Podcast

- Listen to podcasts on the phone.
- Take notes as points on Google Keep, paste the link to the podcast, use the podcast label.
- Every weekend transfer notes to notion by rewriting.
- Transfer to wiki if out of draft, delete draft.

## Video

- Watch it on laptop.
- Take notes on todo.txt.
- Every weekend transfer notes to notion by rewriting.
- Transfer to wiki if out of draft, delete draft.

## MOOC/Video Course

- Pen and Paper note until a section of MOOC videos is finished.
- Transfer notes to a Google Doc, one section at a time. Add things worth remembering to the Anki Deck for the Course.
- Once course is finished, rewrite Google Doc into wiki, delete Google Doc.

## Blogpost

- Save blogpost to pocket, tag laptop only blogposts with `bigscreen`
- Read the blogpost and highlight interesting stuff.
- If `bigscreen` , use ~~Liner~~ and do the same. (Liner turned out to be very unusable.)
- Every weekend transfer notes to notion by rewriting.
- Transfer to wiki if out of draft, delete draft.

## Book

- Read the entire book at one go, if not at one go at least keep consistency. 2-3 days gap means I’ll forget the context. Highlight and keep notes in the book reading app/kindle.
- Re-read the book in 1-2 weeks.
- This time make chapter wise summary in a Google Doc, use Grammarly!
- Transfer the highlights and notes to Google Doc, 1-3 pages per 100 pages is a good count.
- Transfer to wiki if out of draft, delete draft/Google Doc.

## Twitter

- Read the twitter thread once, keep interesting ideas in mind. _(Optional)_
- Re-read the twitter thread the second time making point-wise notes of interesting ideas in notion/Keep/~todo.txt.
- Convert the list of points into a paragraph for the summary of the tweet.
- Transfer to wiki if out of draft, delete draft.

## Paper

- Print the paper, highlight it.
- Make a Google Doc for it in the Paper Notes directory rewriting a summary in your own words.
- Naming the Google Doc can also be the name of the topic which can, in turn, contain multiple papers.
- No need to link it to notion.

- Whatever new thing i learn, it either goes in spaced repetition, or i need to apply it regularly and all things that i keep note or build should be so that at some later point in time i can come back and start working on it or learning form it
- Because every single thing that I'll do will be linked to each other, internally and externally. There can be a master image that'll always get updated. So every piece of work that i do can be compressed into that image.
- Have a backdoor for a banner across all your webpages, in case if you want to announce anything you just update it in once place and all your outlets that you have on the internet have that message

  this or use ideas from this for my workflow
- https://notes.stonecharioteer.com/ i like the disclaimer
  - While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and neither is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my notes and search through them when I’m on a phone or a tablet.  If you’d like to use the interview prep roadmap, feel free, but note that it is a roadmap that works for me (at least I’d like to assume so, but I’ll update this if I get the job I’m looking for), and might not work for you.
- have  a thankful for page, thankful people, technogolies, inventions etc.
